# Minecraft Server Status - Discord Bot

A simple [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) bot that displays the status of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com) servers using the
[mcstatus.io](https://mcstatus.io/) library.

bot to your server.

## Usage

`/status [server|ip] [type]` Displays the current status and active players for any server

`/monitor ip [nickname] [type]` Create 2 voice channels that display the status of a Minecraft server and optionally set a nickname

`/nickname nickname [server]` Change the nickname of a monitored Minecraft server

`/default server` Set a server to be the default for all commands

`/unmonitor [server|all]` Remove the voice channels for the specified server or all servers

`/bug` Send a bug report to the developers

### Usage notes:

**Bedrock servers:** to use the `/status` and `/monitor` commands, you must set the `type` option to "Bedrock" for the bot to function correctly.

**Aternos/other hosting users:** Underscores are not allowed in Domain names! Please change your server address to remove underscores.
